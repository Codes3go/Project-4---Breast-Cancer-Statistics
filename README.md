# Project-4---Breast-Cancer-Statistics
The US Department of Health and Human Services has provided a set of indicators that allows states to consistently define, collect and report chronic disease information relevant to public health. The indicators include questions on Mammography use and Breast cancer mortality rates, with the results reported by different categories, including overall rates per state and race. 

This repository includes the following files:

Project 4 - Breast Cancer Statistics - data exploration and cleaning – which details the process of importing, exploring and cleaning the dataset in preparation for analysis

Project 4 – Breast Cancer Statistics - plots and analysis – which contains four research questions, plots to visualize the answers to those questions and insight on factors that may have influenced these results.
